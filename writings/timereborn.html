<h3>Review</h3>
<p>

I recently read "Time Reborn" by Lee Smolin to find that it is rife with philisophical confusions. As I will point out in the
following paragraphs, he implicitly views laws of nature as causal platonic entities, which leads to all sorts of
issues. He also assumes that his view requires the relatity of time, which is true. 
<br><br>
In "Time Reborn" Lee Smolin argues that a complete physics will require affirm the reality of time, 
and sketches an ontology that includes evolving laws of physics, which he takes to be necesary for resolving issues 
like fine tuning without the anthropic principle. While I agree with his intution that physics has abandoned the manifest image
of time without realizing the questions that creates, I think the book is rife with philisophical confusions and faulty reasoning.
<br><br>
One of the central confusions in the book is his implicit understanding of what the laws of physics are. When the view he implicitly takes
is made explicit and replaced with a more adequte understanding of natural laws, it becomes clear that his initial reasons for affirming
 the reality of time are faulty, and the ontology of evolving laws he builds on it is incoherent. 
<br><br>
Smolin's understanding of natural laws seems to be one of "governace", that is, the laws of physics, which exist apart from the physical world,
govern or enforce the dynamics of the material objects that exist at each moment in time. While this view may seem innocent especially
considering that governance termenology is common parlance in physics departments, on closer examination this view is ill defined and
unintuitive. First off, this view seems to entail that the laws of physics exist in some platonic realm, independent of the physical
world. Prima facie this view seems vague and will have to contend with all the standard objections to platonism. The most important issue, however,
is that it's unclear how these timeless and mysteriously existing platonic entities are supposed to have any causal impact on the world.
To be fair, Smolin does acknowlege this problem in less clear terms, responding that the laws of physics must be "in the materials" rather
than existing apart from them. To me, this response seems like hand waving rather than a serious suggestion, and if what the response comes
down to is that the platonic realm of laws should be thought to have some closer physical proximity to the physical world, this clearly
isn't going to help resolve the problem of how the laws interact, and it's not even clear that the idea is coherent given that the
platonic realm is timeless and the physical world is not.
<br><br>
To the presentist, a much more promising account of natural laws is an Aristetelian one. On this view, materials
have certain dispositions (for example, electrons have the tendency to repel each other), from which causal interactions emerge. The laws
of nature are descriptions of the tendencies that emerge from the fundemental dispositions. This view faces none of the philisophical issues
and internal confusions of the platonic view, and I think is much more intuitive upon even a cursury examination. This view does have
to content with Humean objections (as does the platonic view), but for now I'll presuppose it to make a few points.
<br><br>
Smolin argues in order to solve fine tuning issues, it is necessary to grant the existense of a multiverse where the laws of physics themselves
evolve over time. The reality of time is necessary for this evolution to be possible. He speculates that new universes generated on the 
back sides of black holes may form with slightly altered physical constants, and we find ourselves in one of the universes where the 
physical constants evolved to values that supported the evolution of life. On the platonic conception of laws, this basically means
that the numerical constants in the laws are altered slightly at the beginning of each universe, and these equations then govern the
motions of the materials in that universe in slightly altered ways. So if an electron might enter a black hole under one set of physical laws,
and emerge on the other side evolving differently under new laws. However, if we reinterpret this idea under a better conception of natural laws,
it makes much less intuitive sense. On the Aristitelian conception, this would mean that somehow the electron enters the black hole with one set of 
dispositions and somehow emerges on the other side with different metaphysical dispositions. So somehow transforms into a different kind of
thing while passing through the black hole. When Smolins central idea is made explicit in this way, it becomes clear that he doesn't
provide the mechanism necessary for the physical constants to change from universe to universe. On the Aristitelian conception, there's
no reason to think the electron would behave any differently than it did in the previous universe. 
<br><br>
My second main issue with the book is that his reasoning for affirming the reality of time in the first place is faulty. To summarize, he
believes that in order for the laws of physics to evolve in a way that could solve fine tuning issues, there must be some objective
present relative to which the laws are evolving. This seems wrong. In the 4D block picture, the patterning that is sumarized in a best
system account of laws could simply vary accross space, such that a best system account of laws at different locations would require
different physical constants. 
<br><br>
If I understand his claims correctly, the mitakes he makes are relativley elementrary, and I'm disappointed a 
well known professional physicist would make them. It is understandable, however, given that little philisophical rigour is required
to suceed in a physics degree. It is unfortunate that physics and philosophy have diverged in this way, as speculation about
important issues in, for example, the foundations of quantum mechanics and cosmology could benefit from some philisophical clarity.
