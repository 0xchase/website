Wilfred Sellars famously suggested that the aim of philosophy is to "understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term". His observation contrasts philosophy with the scientific project, which deals more directly with empirical matters through observation and experimentation. Given the power the scientific method has to uncover and explain facts about the natural world, philosophy's main task since the scientific revolution has been to examine how different ideas fit together (i.e. their coherence), and to give an account of how the processes postulated by scientific theories connect to the manifest image. Unfortunatley, due in part to increased specialization in academia, most academic diciplines have been fractionated into smaller and smaller sub-diciplines. Beyond just the stagnation, loss of the big picture, etc this fragmentation creates, it can also cause sub-fields to hyper-specialize the methodology they employ. 
<br>
In physics, this problem manifests in the "shut up and calculate" mentaility as well as the broader hostility towards work in the foundations of quantum mechanics. The fact that most physics education reflects the specialization of the methodology is exemplified by physicists like Smolin and Krauss, who's speculations about more big picture issues are rife with philisophical confusions and blatent misunderstandings that a broader education might have helped them avoid. I don't, however, think philosophy has been immune to these changes in academia. While dealing with the coherence of ideas is an important task of philosophy, I think much of the work since David Lewis has lost site of the fact that coherence with other ideas is not a sufficient reason to think a view is correct. In the end, it seems to me that what we really care about is that our metaphysics explains the world. As I will argue, while Humean approaches to laws of nature may be perfectly coherent (as the many followers of Lewis have spent large amounts of time arguing), the project of Humean Supervenience simply doesn't explain central features of our world, which I take to be reason it should be thought of as incomplete or rejected outright, regardless of it's neatness, simplicity, coherence, etc.
