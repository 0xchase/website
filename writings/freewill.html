<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Free will is as important a concept as any other in the history as philosophy, not only because it is inextricably tied to other notions like moral reponsibility and meaning, but also because most people's intuitive understanding of it seems to be in conflict with a scientific picture of the world. Fortunatley, unlike many other philisophical issues, I feel I fully understand this one, so I will try to layout my position along with the relevant background information below. 

<br><br>

There are many definitions of free will but it intuitivley has something to do with the ability to choose otherwise. It would seem to follow that if, in any real sense, one has the ability to choose differently, then that choice must also not be fully determined by past events. It is this view that is in conflict with a mechanistic understanding of the world because, thus concieved, there is only one possible course of actions that will follow from some initial state. 

<br><br>

Why should we believe that events preceed deterministically when our intuitions about our choices are to the contrary? 

Laws of physics, chemistry, etc

Genes or circumstances
Libet

Deterministic or indeterministic

Idea itself is incoherent a priori

<h3>Objections to determinism</h3>

There are still those who would deny determinism for a variety of reasons that I mostly consider misunderstandings. One valid complaint against the <i>fatalist</i> is that there appears to be indeterminism in quantum mechanics. First of all, the idea that we know quantum mechanics implies indeterminism is itself a misunderstanding. Most viable interpretations: many worlds, bohmian mechanics, etc are effectivley deterministic. However, even if an indeterministic interpretation like GRW is correct, it's irrelevant to the free will debate. After all, when one rolls a dice and it lands on a 3, it wouldn't make any sense to say the person "chose" the 3. This analogy extends to the quantum case. In addition, even if there is indeterminism at the quantum level, it does not follow that this indeterminism is relevantly manifest in the microscopic world. 

<br><br>

Another objection to determinism comes from holism. Some would claim that the behavior of a macroscopic system like the brain is irreducible to the chemical parts that make it up. For this reason, even if physics proceeded deterministically it wouldn't follow that one's actions proceed the same way. Now, in general the arguments for holism are bad but it is true that an entangled quantum system should be treated holistically, but these states are far too fragile to remain coherent in the brain and so are irrelevant to free will. However, even if entangled quantum states were essential to brain function (as suggested by Penrose-Hameroff for example), it is a misunderstanding to think that these systems would proceed any less deterministically. If we consider the entangled particles case, despite the systems irreducibility, the system still proceeds deterministically according to the schrodinger equation, it's just that the equation describes the particles <i>as a whole</i> instead of as seperate entities. So it seems that holism doesn't actually help with recovering a libertarian perspective on free will.

<br><br>

Irriducibility of conciousness

A soul? Rational soul of aristotle: chain or reasoning is deterministic. Otherwise, the nature of the soul. Actions seem to be explained by brain function, soul can't be that relevant. 

<br><br>

<h3>Compatibilism</h3>

The arguments above seem to paint a bleak picture. If my actions are ultimatley determined by the laws of physics, why should I even get up in the morning? Why should I do anything at all when it's ultimatley not up to me? I think these types of worries originate from a misunderstanding of the problem. While I do think the above poses a significant challenge to the libertarian, I think a better understanding of the problem shows that determinism is perfectly compatible with a kind of free will.

<br><br>

Just because it's explained doesn't mean it isn't real.
Ordinary language talk is perfectly sensible.

Volition
Maps onto ordinary language talk of free will

Redefining free will

Moral responsibility
Dualism: For reasons or not

Everything else is semantic. Libet, quantum: all distractions. 

How are we different than a computer? We have a will.
