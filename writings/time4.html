<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
	The longstanding debate over the A and B theories of time is often thought to have been closed by Einstein's theory of relativity. As the argument goes, according to A theories (or at least presentism), only a single present, consisting of a set of simultaneous events, exists. However, within the most straightforward interpretation of relativity, it is meaningless to talk about simultaneity except relative to a chosen reference frame, which is in clear conflict with presentism. I will argue that despite the conflict between presentism and relativity, it would be premature to conclude that presentism is in conflict with our broader understanding of physics. It is well known that relativity and/or QM is incomplete. Most interpretations of quantum mechanics have absolute simultaneity built in (though it’s often by design), and I will argue that there are some general problems with any method for making those interpretations Lorentz invariant. One could argue that this prima facie evidence in favor of simultaneity is at least as strong as the evidence from relativity against it. My point is not to reiterate the well known conflict between these two theories, but is instead to argue that the relationship between presentism and physics should remain open as long as relativity and QM remain unreconciled. 

	Bell’s theorem was an important theorem concerning whether particles in an entangled state could be mutually dependant when separated at large distances. Bell showed that local hidden variable theories made, under certain conditions, make different predictions from standard quantum mechanics. The eventual experimental violation of Bell’s inequalities essentially ruled out any local hidden variable theories. Since Bell there have been a wide array of strategies for interpreting quantum mechanics without locality. I will attempt to show that most of these strategies point towards absolute simultaneity.

	A full elaboration on the supposed conflict will require a discussion of specific interpretations. But first, we’ll get an intuition for the general problem by considering real collapse theories. Consider a pair of electrons, A and B, in the state ½( |+> |-> - |-> |+>).

At t1 particle A is measured for x spin and particle B is measured for z spin. By applying STR, we can see that there exist foliations of this space-time diagram where A is measured first, and others where B is measured first. This means we can trace at least two possible histories of the system. An example for each foliation is shown below.
